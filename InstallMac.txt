Installation on Mac: 

Put the folder SCMIRExtensions in your extensions directory. If you need hints on how to do that, see the [Using-Extensions] help file in SuperCollider (also linked in Main Help)

One Warning: if you already have the sc3-plugins, and you put all of them into your extensions already, you may get a duplicate SCMIRUGens. The fix is simple; look within SCMIRExtensions. You just need the SCMIR folder itself (the classes and executables) and not the bundled SCMIRUGens, which are included for self-completeness for the majority of users independent of sc3-plugins.  


Compilation: Whilst pre-compiled executables for Mac are provided, you can compile the executables yourself using CMake. 

If you don't have Cmake installed, you can get it from MacPorts, for example. 

cd /path/to/SCMIR/Source
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='i386;x86_64' .. 
make
make install
