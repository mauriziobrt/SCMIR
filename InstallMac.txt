Installation on Mac: 

Put the folder SCMIRExtensions in your extensions directory. If you need hints on how to do that, see the [Using-Extensions] help file in SuperCollider (also linked in Main Help)

Compilation: Whilst pre-compiled executables for Mac are provided, you can compile the executables yourself using CMake. 

If you don't have Cmake installed, you can get it from MacPorts, for example. 


cd /path/to/SCMIR/Source
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='i386;x86_64' .. 
  make
  make install
